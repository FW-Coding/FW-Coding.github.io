      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <p class="intro-text">
        A selection of technical work spanning battery modelling, parameter estimation, electrochemical diagnostics, 
        and energy system design. These projects combine physics-based simulation with experimental data to address 
        practical challenges in battery technology.

          <h2>Transmission Line Models for Lithium Plating</h2>
          <p>
            Developing a novel transmission line (TL) architecture to model and detect lithium plating on graphite 
            anodes. This work combines electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data, custom distribution of 
            relaxation times (DRT) inversion, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements to quantify plating 
            severity and validate model predictions. The approach offers a new diagnostic pathway for identifying 
            early-stage degradation and informing safe charging protocols.
          </p>
          <p>
            Conducted in collaboration with the Bazant group at MIT and Imperial's Electrochemical Science and 
            Engineering (ESE) group as part of my master's thesis.

          <h2>Parameter Estimation Pipeline</h2>
          <p>
            Built a complete parameter estimation workflow that processes raw cycling data from Novonix cyclers, 
            extracts key features, and fits Doyle-Fuller-Newman (DFN) model parameters using customised particle 
            swarm optimisation (PSO). The pipeline achieves approximately 50 mV error in voltage predictions across 
            multiple operating conditions, demonstrating accurate capture of cell behaviour.
          </p>
          <p>
            As part of this work, I contributed column mapping for the Novonix cycler to the open-source PyProBE 
            package, enabling smoother integration of experimental data into battery modelling workflows.

          <h2>Electric Race Car Battery Packs</h2>
          <p>
            Led a team of five students designing and building bespoke battery packs and battery management systems 
            (BMS) for Imperial Racing Green's electric race car. Responsibilities included modelling track energy 
            requirements to determine optimal capacity and discharge rates, performing cell selection, executing 
            pack assembly (spot-welding, soldering), and integrating the system with the vehicle's powertrain.
          </p>
          <p>
            The team coordinated extensive testing and validation to ensure safe, high-performance operation, 
            ultimately achieving strong competition results and demonstrating the practical application of battery 
            engineering principles.

          <h2>Finite-Volume PyBaMM Implementation</h2>
          <p>
            Implemented the first example of PyBaMM applied to a complex fluid-dynamics style system using a 
            finite-volume method in Python. This work extended PyBaMM's capabilities beyond standard electrochemical 
            models and demonstrated the versatility of the framework for multiphysics problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            For effectively communicating this technical work to diverse audiences, I won a Student Science 
            Communicator award and received the best poster prize at a PyBaMM/FUSE event. The project was completed 
            during a summer internship with the Faraday Institution's FUSE programme.
