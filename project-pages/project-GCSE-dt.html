        <p>
          A GCSE Design & Technology project focused on designing and building a storage cabinet specifically 
          tailored for students with visual impairments. The project followed a complete design process from 
          research and specification through to manufacture and evaluation.
        </p>

        <h2>Project Brief</h2>
        <p>
          The project addressed the need for accessible storage solutions in educational environments. Students 
          with visual impairments often face challenges locating and organising their belongings in standard 
          furniture. This project aimed to create a storage solution that could be navigated through tactile 
          features and intuitive organisation.
        </p>

        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Research:</strong> Investigation into the needs of visually impaired users and existing accessible furniture designs</li>
          <li><strong>Specification:</strong> Development of detailed requirements based on user needs and manufacturing constraints</li>
          <li><strong>Concept Development:</strong> Generation and evaluation of multiple design concepts</li>
          <li><strong>Detailed Design:</strong> Technical drawings and material specifications</li>
          <li><strong>Manufacture:</strong> Construction of the final product using workshop tools and techniques</li>
          <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Testing and assessment against the original specification</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <p>
          The cabinet incorporated several accessibility features designed to aid navigation and use by 
          students with visual impairments, including tactile markers, contrasting colours, and logical 
          compartment organisation.
        </p>

        <h2>Skills Developed</h2>
        <p>
          This project developed practical woodworking skills, CAD modelling, understanding of user-centred 
          design principles, and experience with the complete design-make-evaluate cycle. It also highlighted 
          the importance of designing for accessibility and inclusivity.
