        <p>
          A comprehensive design and engineering project focused on the teardown, characterisation, and redesign 
          of a hand-held drill. This multi-phase project combined reverse engineering, materials analysis, 
          mechanical design, and technical documentation to understand existing products and propose improvements.
        </p>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The project involved systematically disassembling a commercial hand-held drill, characterising its 
          components and materials, analysing the design decisions, and proposing an improved redesign. This 
          hands-on approach provided insight into manufacturing processes, material selection, cost optimization, 
          and design for assembly.
        </p>

        <h2>Project Phases & Reports</h2>
        <p>
          The project was documented through three comprehensive reports tracking progress from initial analysis 
          through to final redesign:

        <h2>Key Technical Skills</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Reverse Engineering:</strong> Systematic disassembly and documentation of complex mechanical systems</li>
          <li><strong>Materials Characterisation:</strong> Identification and analysis of component materials and their properties</li>
          <li><strong>Mechanical Design:</strong> Understanding of gear systems, motors, bearings, and power transmission</li>
          <li><strong>Manufacturing Analysis:</strong> Assessment of production methods including injection molding, die casting, and assembly</li>
          <li><strong>Cost Engineering:</strong> Material and manufacturing cost estimation and optimization</li>
          <li><strong>Technical Communication:</strong> Professional report writing with clear justification of design decisions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Design Considerations</h2>
        <p>
          The redesign process required balancing multiple competing factors including performance, cost, 
          manufacturability, ergonomics, durability, and environmental impact. Material selection decisions 
          considered mechanical properties, processing requirements, cost, and sustainability. The project 
          demonstrated the complexity of engineering design and the importance of systematic analysis.
        </p>

        <h2>Skills Developed</h2>
        <p>
          This project strengthened practical skills in reverse engineering, materials analysis, CAD modeling, 
          manufacturing process understanding, and technical documentation. The structured approach developed 
          ability to analyze existing products critically and propose evidence-based improvements grounded in 
          materials science and engineering principles.
