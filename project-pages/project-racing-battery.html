        <p>
          Led a team of five students designing and building bespoke battery packs and battery management systems 
          (BMS) for Imperial Racing Green's electric race car competing in Formula Student events. This project 
          combined systems engineering, practical fabrication skills, and rigorous safety validation to deliver 
          a high-performance power system.
        </p>

        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <p>
          Battery pack design for race applications requires balancing competing constraints: maximizing energy 
          density and power capability while minimizing weight and ensuring absolute safety compliance with 
          competition regulations.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Requirements Analysis:</strong> Modelled race track profiles to determine energy consumption, peak power demands, and thermal loads</li>
          <li><strong>Cell Selection:</strong> Evaluated commercial cells based on energy density, power capability, thermal performance, and cost</li>
          <li><strong>Pack Architecture:</strong> Designed series-parallel configuration to meet voltage and capacity requirements</li>
          <li><strong>BMS Integration:</strong> Selected and configured BMS for cell monitoring, balancing, and protection</li>
          <li><strong>Thermal Management:</strong> Incorporated cooling strategies to maintain safe operating temperatures during high-power discharge</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Fabrication & Testing</h2>
        <p>
          Pack assembly required precision and attention to detail. The team performed spot-welding for cell 
          interconnections, soldered bus bars and balance leads, and integrated the pack into a protective enclosure 
          meeting safety requirements.
        </p>

        <p>
          Extensive validation testing included capacity verification, internal resistance measurement, thermal 
          imaging under load, and safety testing (short circuit protection, overcharge/overdischarge protection, 
          thermal runaway containment).
        </p>

        <h2>Competition Performance</h2>
        <p>
          The battery pack successfully powered the vehicle through multiple competition events, demonstrating 
          reliable performance under demanding conditions. The team achieved strong results in technical inspection 
          and endurance events, validating our design and fabrication approach.
        </p>

        <h2>Team Leadership</h2>
        <p>
          Leading the battery sub-team involved coordinating design work, managing timelines and budgets, liaising 
          with other subsystems (powertrain, chassis, electronics), and mentoring junior team members. This 
          experience strengthened my project management and communication skills alongside technical battery 
          engineering expertise.
